Testcase #3 - Verify page and formatting responsiveness by expanding and shrinking the browser window.
Testcase #4 - Verify Transactions section displays properly with no errors even when no transaction results are returned from the api call.
Testcase #5 - Verify Transactions data displays properly and without error when some data elements are missing from a transaction object.
